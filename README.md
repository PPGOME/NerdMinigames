# Nerd.nu Zombies minigame

Located here is a fork of the NerdNu CommandHelper repo. I've added the required files to this base script to make the zombie minigame. I had to remove some files due to compilation errors from, what I assume, to be missing databases and such.

The added files are located in the LocalPackages/creative-only/minigames directory of this repo.

Below is the documentation on how to use these scripts.

| Command | Explanation | Permission |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| /nerdarena create <name> | Creates a new arena, based on the worldedit selection, named whatever is specified | nerdarena.create |
